//	1.	The datasheet calls for 1.0 ms of wake-up recovery time, so we add
//		a safety margin of two because the delay.h calls aren't perfect and
//		it's not like we are in a hurry. N.B. these are units of milliseconds.
//
//	2.	The datasheet calls for 1.0 us of delay between changing the step
//		signal, e.g., 1.0 us up, 1.0 us down. We a safety margin of two like
//		we did for the sleep delay. N.B. these are units of microseconds.
//
//	3.	The datasheet calls for 200 ns of delay between changing the direction
//		signal. We use a safety margin of five, since we can't really delay by
//		nanoseconds. N.B. these are units of microseconds.
